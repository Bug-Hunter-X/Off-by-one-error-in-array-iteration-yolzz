This repository contains a simple Java program demonstrating a common off-by-one error in array iteration. The `bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.java` provides the corrected version.  The error results in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` due to attempting to access an index beyond the array's bounds.  This example highlights the importance of carefully considering loop conditions when working with arrays.
